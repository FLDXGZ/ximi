    "In this project, you will write Python functions to tally election results from a set of ballots submitted by voters, using different vote counting systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will write all your code as function definitions, in one of 3 modules: `ballot_data.py`, `pos.py`, `irv.py`, or `stv.py`. The second part of the Week 6 Monday lecture covers writing and using modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each module should **only contain function definitions, and any required `import` statements** (for example if you need to import `numpy`).\n",
    "- For each question, a few simple **tests** will be provided in the notebook. You can use these to start checking that your function works as expected. They work similarly to your Coderunner quizzes.\n",
    "    - In some cases, the tests use `assert` statements (or similar functions from [`np.testing`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.testing.html)).\n",
    "        - `assert X` will do nothing if `X` is `True`.\n",
    "        - `assert X` will produce an `AssertionError` if `X` is `False`.\n",
    "    - The provided tests are minimal (similar to the \"Examples\" provided for pre-checking in the Coderunner quizzes). To make sure that your function works fully with all possible inputs, you should add more of your own tests.\n",
    "    - Any tests that you write yourself will not be assessed.\n",
    "    - Some of the tests load a small amount of ballot data from a `.txt` file. You can look at the data itself by looking at the content of the files.\n",
    "    - When you submit on Gradescope, more automatic tests will be performed. You will see the results of **some** of these tests when you submit; if any fail, you can try to correct your code, and resubmit as many times as you want (until the deadline).\n",
    "    - Gradescope will also have hidden tests which will test your functions further (similar to the further tests in the Coderunner quizzes, which are run when you click \"Check\"). You will not see the results of these tests until the grades and feedback are returned to the class. This means, in particular, that *passing all the visible tests on Gradescope does not guarantee full marks.*\n",
    "- **Up to half** of the marks for a given question may be deducted for poor readability; missing, incomplete, or inaccurate code comments and/or docstrings; poor code structure and efficiency; or poorly displayed results. You can use the CR marking scheme for reference to make sure you submit good-quality code."

    "## Single transferable vote\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, here is a more challenging problem. The **single transferable vote** system, or STV, can be seen as an extension to IRV, in the case where there are multiple seats to fill (instead of a single candidate to elect). For instance, Scottish council elections use this system to elect councillors. [This is a great explainer](https://ballotbox.scot/councils/stv-explained/), with an example from Glasgow from the 2017 local elections -- you can refer to this for a more detailed explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic principle of votes transferring between candidates according to second preferences is broadly the same as in IRV. The key difference is that there are 2 possible situations where votes can be transferred:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When a candidate is eliminated, their second preference votes are fully transferred to the other candidates (exactly as in IRV).\n",
    "- When a candidate is _elected_, their **surplus** second preference votes are also transferred to the other candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of eliminating candidates until we are left with just one, we need to first check, at every round, whether any candidates are **elected**. A candidate is elected if they have at least a required quota of first-preference votes. This quota is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{quota} = \\frac{\\text{number of votes}}{\\text{number of seats} + 1} + 1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we use integer division.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a candidate is **elected**, their second preference votes are also transferred to other candidates, but with a **weighting** equal to\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\text{number of first preference votes} - \\text{quota}}{\\text{number of first preference votes}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if the quota is 100 first-preference votes to get elected, and a candidate got 120 first-preference votes, the weighting is equal to $\\frac{120 - 100}{120} = 0.2$. The second-preference votes in the ballots which had placed this candidate as first preference are then redistributed amongst the other candidates, with a weighting of 0.2, meaning that each second-preference vote counts for 0.2 vote for the candidate upon which the vote has been redistributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "When no candidates currently have enough votes to go over the quota, we revert back to eliminating the least popular candidate, following the same procedure as for IRV. This time, their second-preference votes are redistributed with a weighting of 1 to the other candidates (as in IRV).\n",

    "In `stv.py`, write a function `stv_results()` which takes 2 input arguments:\n",
